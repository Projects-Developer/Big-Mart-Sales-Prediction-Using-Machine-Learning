## Abstract: 
This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast sales of various products at Big Mart stores. The model leverages historical sales data and explores the relationships between item attributes, store characteristics, and sales. By employing regression analysis and supervised learning techniques, the project seeks to improve sales forecasting accuracy, enabling Big Mart to optimize inventory management, reduce waste, and enhance profitability. The project utilizes Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras, and evaluates model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared. The results of this project can be applied to real-world retail scenarios, providing actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

Keywords: Big Mart Sales Prediction, Machine Learning, Regression Analysis, Supervised Learning, Sales Forecasting, Retail Analytics, Business Intelligence
